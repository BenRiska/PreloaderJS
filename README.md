# PreloaderJS
An Aircraft Themed Javascript/CSS Preload Animation

Hello and welcome to my preload animation, this was a project i started in order to get a better understanding of CSS keyframes + transitions. Please note that you may want to use your browser settings to simulate a slow connection or it may be hard to view. Alternatively you could remove the 'transition' property from the 'preload' class in css or disable the window function in javascript to have the preloader placed permanently on the screen to inspect.

Feel free to use it in your own work.
